/*
 * Connection objects connect two anchor objects and is represented by a line
 * between the two anchors. The anchors must be of opposite directions (in/out)
 *
 * The connection object has two families of mutators:
 * 1) Anchor based mutators, these mutators will attach drag listeners to the 
 *    anchors parent and update itself while the parent is moving
 * 2) Point based mutators, these are used during the creation stage of the
 *    anchors life. These don't attach any new listeners, they just update the
 *    point, then redraw
 *
 * This object extends Kinetic.Line
